UPDATE ON PORTFOLIO AFTER PROJECT #2

In this update I added

A group project link
A link to a project deployed on heroku 


I updated the navbar by adding an icon as well as new font from google fonts

I used new css technology to make the buttons appear to be pushed down when clicked
I also used more new css to make the div in the container pop bigger when hovered but stay static on smaller viewports

I added dropdowns for the projects because it would have been to long to keep using nested lists. They line up with each other in each dropdown. One being the link to the live project, and the other being the back end code. 


My resume is moved to the middle section of the footer in the list item
